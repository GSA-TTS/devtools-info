# TTS DevTools - General information

TTS DevTools is a program in GSA's Technology Transformation Services with
a mission to dramatically reduce the burden of starting and maintaining digital
services in government.

What burden, you ask?

- The burden of missing the tools and "factory floor" to collaboratively work,
  secure, and deploy code.
- The burden of having a wide, overlapping, and hard-to-reason-with set of minimum
  requirements to meet for even the most basic public facing web site.
- The burden of a compliance process centered on massive documents and spreadsheets,
  living outside of where the digital service teams live.

In other words, the usual platform engineering concerns, with an extra dose of
regulation. Luckily, many of the services and components teams need already exist,
including:

- cloud.gov PaaS to run and operate applications in a FISMA Moderate setting
- Login.gov to provide authentication and identity services to the full scope of
  the public
- USWDS to provide a consistent and high quality design system to make sites
  look good, behave well, and support the broadest range of users

## Story

In order to make the case for DevTools to TTS leadership, potential customers, and the broader community of federal technologists, we put together a "Short Stack" -- which includes a look at the complexities we aim to simplify, the economy of our approach, and a story from the point of view of our target audience.

## History

While the program started as a project of 18F and evolved into a full program in 2023,
the problems DevTools works to solve are hardly new. What was new was having
a team focused on improving efficiency for the end to end secure software development
life cycle.
